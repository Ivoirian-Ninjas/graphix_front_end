              <p>
                   With the recent pandemic that hit the world, more and more businesses started to realize that having an online presence is unavoidable. <br/>
                   However, building a web or a mobile application is not an easy task. <br/>
                   Also, the price of hiring a team of developers can seem exorbitant at times. <br/>
                   It is in this scope that Graphix was born. Graphix is a small team of developers with the sole goal of helping businesses rise to the top. <br/>
                   Because we put the customer first, Graphix provides web services at an affordable price.
