                Frugality, Quality, and Thinking Big are our core values. <br/>
                Hence, those values represent the foundation of Graphix. <br/>
                Following these values, allows us to start with the customer and work backward.

               <p>
                    With the recent pandemic that hit the world, more and more businesses started to realize that having an online presence is unavoidable. <br/>
                    However, building a web or a mobile application is not an easy task. <br/>
                    Also, the price of hiring a team of developers can seem exorbitant at times. <br/>
                    It is in this scope that Graphix was born. Graphix is a small team of developers with the sole goal of helping businesses rise to the top. <br/>
                    Because we put the customer first, Graphix provides web services at an affordable price.
